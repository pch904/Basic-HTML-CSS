			<h2>Latest News</h2>
			<p>When Intel announced their new LGA2066 HEDT platform at Computex 2017, it came as a surprise to many since the company wasn't expected to unveil their new X299 chipset and mix of Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors until much later in the year. And they certainly weren't expected to announce any 12, 14, 16, and 18-core processors this generation. While only one of those high-core count models has been released, what we do have is a bunch of interesting X299 motherboards and some potent processors like the ten-core Core i9-7900X and the high frequency quad-core Core i7-7740X.

ASUS has currently revealed seven LGA2066 motherboards spread across the PRIME, TUF, and ROG product lines. The STRIX X299-E GAMING model that are reviewing today represents the most affordable entry into the Republic of Gamers X299 family with a retail price of about $345 USD / $420 CAD. This price point places in behind both the overclocking-focused Rampage VI Apex and the extravagant Rampage VI Extreme. In fact, you could say that the X299-E is the only 'normal' ROG X299 model available right now.</p>

					If you follow Hardware Canucks on Twitter (and you should!) you’ll know that a few weeks ago I shipped a Ryzen 7 1700X processor to Anthony –aka AkG- and let’s just say that things didn’t quite go as planned. Even though it was securely packaged in a padded, form-fitting box and then packaged in another secondary motherboard box, the darn thing opened, spilling its precious cargo directly into harm’s way.

					Due to the fact that Intel had to carefully manage power consumption and thermals on such a massive die, frequencies suffer when all the cores are fully engaged. This has led to an extremely low Base clock of just 2.6GHz while the two Turbo modes –which are enabled when the chip isn’t operating under full load- are more respectable and range from 4.2GHz to 4.4GHz.

					Since we have already reviewed two of the three motherboards that AMD handpicked to send to reviewers for the Ryzen launch, it only makes sense for us to review the third, the ASUS Crosshair VI Hero. However, while that day will come, today we are focused on reviewing the most expensive AMD AM4 motherboard on the market right now, the MSI X370 XPower Gaming Titanium.

					AMD to effectively turn the x86 processor world on its ear, but that’s also the number of distinct model families that they’ve introduced over a relatively short time. The rapid staccato of desktop market releases with Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5, Ryzen 3, the new Athlon X4’s and Bristol Ridge-based A-9000 APUs have left Intel scrambling to find answers
				</span></a></li>

					In the demo system at CES there was a Ryzen 7 1700, a Radeon RX580 GPU, 16GB of memory and a 1TB SSHD. When this eventually launches into the retail channel there will also be Ryzen 5 1600 and Ryzen 3 1200 processors available in some configurations. Ironically, this is the first time we have seen official confirmation of the existence of a Ryzen 3 1200.
